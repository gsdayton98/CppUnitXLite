Welcome to the C++ Extra Light Unit Testing Framework

To use, include the header file CppUnitXLite.hpp in your own unit test.  Read
the header file for its documentation on how to use it.

CppUnitXLiteTests contain unit tests for the framework itself and may be used
as an example of using CppUnitXLiteTest.

To make the tests, change the working directory to CppUnitXLiteTests and perform

    make -f CppUnitXLite.mak
