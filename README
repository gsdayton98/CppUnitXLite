Welcome to the C++ Extra Light Unit Testing Framework

To use, include the file CppUnitXLite.cpp in your own unit test. That's right,
include the .cpp file. Read the header file, CppUnitXLite.hpp, for its
documentation on how to use it. If your test spans multiple source files,
you may compile CppUnitXLite separately and include CppUnitXLite.hpp where
you need it. For simple single source tests, just include CppUnitXLite.cpp
to spare you the trouble of multiple compilations.

CppUnitXLiteTests contain unit tests for the framework itself and may be used
as an example of using CppUnitXLiteTest. The framework compiles the definition
file, CppUnitXLite.cpp, separately and links it. Three files implement the
CPPUnitXLite tests just to prove that multi-source files tests can be created.

To make the tests, change the working directory to CppUnitXLite/test and perform

    make

You may also use Bazel to run the tests with

    bazel test ...

As you work and modify this framework, please keep it simple as possible and
no simpler. If you want GoogleTest style ASSERT and CHECK -- please don't. If
you want to abort the test program, do it yourself in the program, and don't
expect the framework to do it for you. If you want the results logged to
someplace else, derive from the TestResult class and use your own main() to
use it. CppUnitXLiteTests.cpp is an example of replacing TestResults with
a child so you can do your own logging.

test/CppUnitXLite.cpp is an example of tests using the convenience macros.
test/NoMacroTests.cpp essentially do the same thing without the convenience
macros. Not using the convenience macros allows you to customize the error
messages. The test CheckEqualTest in test/NoMacroTests.cpp demonstrates
you may mix the two approaches.


WHY?

Most unit testing frameworks take their inspiration from frameworks for other
languages, missing the power and elegance of C++. They implement features not
needed in a compiled and linked language like C++. For example, in C++, if
you need a global test framework, just define one. You don't need to
co-ordinate it with unit testing. If you need to override a system library
function, just define one and link it before the library. Most frameworks
depend upon macros to do their magic. CppUnitXLite demonstrates C++ allows
you to do the same things without macros.

As simple as CppUnitXLite seems to be, maybe it can be more elegant and
simple. The driver is main(), which creates the TestRegistry. A
Registry is a collection of tests. TestResults are a collection of
Failures. TestResults also report the failures. See the dichotomy of
purpose of TestResults? The Test class itself has methods checkEqual(),
checkLE(), checkLT(), checkGE(), checkGT(), checkAppoxEqual() -- which
seems like a lot of repetition of logic. Maybe we'll have to wait for
C++14 to become more prevalent to use lambdas to avoid repeating code
so many times. If you think of better ways to do this, please do it.

Please note that the initial version of CppUnitXLite makes no attempt
at internationalization.
